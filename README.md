# BayesProjekt
<p>
  This is a final project for a subject Bayesiánská analýza on Masaryk University,
  In this Project we are trying to find a connection between average rating of a movie and a genre of the movie.
  Our proposal is that each genre has statisticaly significant difference in average rating. For example action movies would have bigger overall rating in comparison to for example horror movies.
